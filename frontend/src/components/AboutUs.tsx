            ReuseU is a sustainability project for college students, by college
            students. On move-out day, do you find that you have a bunch of
            stuff you don't need anymore? Or, during the school year, you need
            a new coffee maker, but the ones at the store are too expensive?
            Worry no longer! We as a team set out to create a way for students
            to buy and exchange their goods throughout the year. The average
            college student creates 640 pounds of trash annually, and our hope
            is that ReuseU will become a place for students to help reduce and
            reuse items that students accumulate throughout the year. We as a
            team came together through the trenches of our Grinnell College
            Software Development class, CSC-324, and this is the project that
            resulted from that!
